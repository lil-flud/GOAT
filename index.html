        <h1>The Greatest Live Performance You'll Ever Experience!</h1>
        <p>
          Dave Matthews Band is the most talented collection of musicians you
          will find in the Jam Band scene.<br />No two live shows are alike,
          every time you hear them play a particular song it is like hearing
          them play it for the first time.<br />They have had many
          accomplishments in their career: 14 grammy nominations with one
          resulting in a win, ranked in the Top<br />100 Most Sold Albums in the
          USA at 31 million sold, 5 Top Selling Albums, multiple Rock Hall Of
          Fame Nominations, and<br />many more! While the have a very
          accomplished studio career, their live performances are what really
          makes them stand out.<br />Their heavy emphasis on improvisation and
          deep roster of songs makes every show feel as like a brand new
          experience.<br />If you would like to learn more about the band's

            The man himself. Aside from being the founder of the band he plays a
            few roles: lead singer, main songwriter,<br />and rhythym guitarist.
            Dave was born in South Africa and went on to live all around the
            world throughout his life,<br />which is often cited as a large
            reason for why the band has such a "worldly" sound. Inspiration was
            taken from a<br />lot of different places when he was living abroad.
            For example; their song Minarets is remniscient of middle eastern<br />music.
